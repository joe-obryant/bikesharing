The following worksheet displays the most common checkout times during the duration of the trip. Where we see that a vast majority of the trips ending in the first 20 or so minutes.

This worksheet displays the same information above but broken down by Gender. From this we can conclude that Males make up a much larger base of the users.

This worksheet displays the stoptimes by hour for each week of the day. The heatmap displays darker blocks for hours that trips end at more. From the heatmap we can see that the later days of the week, especially during the hours of 5pm to 6pm is when most trips end.

This worksheet displays the same information as above but broken down by Gender. Again from this heatmap we can see that Males are still the most common user.

Here we see the heatmap break down of Customer vs Subscriber and when trips are taken by Days of the week, filtered by Gender. Again showing that Men are the primary Subscribers who take more trips later in the week.

## Summary
The vizulations above provide a lot of insight into Citibike's success in NYC and that data can be used to determine if the success can translate across other cities. Based on the data above we can see that the majority of users are male so if this was to be implemented in another city, it should be targeted at cities that have a greater male then female population. For future visulizations, repeated trips by customers vs subscribers should be looked at to see if there are any future subscribers being missed out on. Then this should visulization should be broken down by gender as well.
